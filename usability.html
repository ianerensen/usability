<h1>"Usability Study"</h1>


<ul>
<li>
    <h2>method</h2>
    <p>The webiste studied was the Carrefour online shopping website.
        The target audience of this website is the everyday shopper, looking for household goods that are needed for that week.
        The tasks we used to test the usability of this website were. To  find a bottle of one liter dish washing fluid, look for a y piece tupperware set,
        and find a can of heinz baked beans. 
    </p>
</li>

<li>
    <h2>results</h2>
    <p> All three of the tasks were completed with minimal difficulty. Each task took under three clicks to find what they were looking for.
        The only task that proved a small problem was finding the tupperware set, you had to be fairly specific in explaining what you were actually looking for.

    <h2>discussion</h2>
    <p> This study helped us understand that this website is well designed. But a way it could be improved is it could have a side navigation bar to accurately find what they want.</p>
